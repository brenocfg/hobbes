Code for an Introduction to Robotics class. Language is MIT's HandyBoard Interactive C (yes, this is ancient).

This code was written to control a LEGO robot built by the group's students,
through the use of a HandyBoard microcontroller. Each task/project involves
having the robot perform various tasks, either as a simple manipulator or as
a full sensoring-decision-acting loop autonomous robot.

The code is mostly straightforward, and involves for the most part interacting
with DC motor outputs and various sensor inputs/outputs.
